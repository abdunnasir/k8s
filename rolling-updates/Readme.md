##### How to get public IP to show nginx default page
**Service expose the deploymnet to the an IP.**

窶義``
kubectl get nodes -o wide
窶義``

The above command gave INTERNAL-IP as  172.24.0.3

窶義``
kubectl get svc
窶義``

gave an out put
nginx-service   NodePort    10.96.169.150   <none>        80:31118/TCP   22m
So the IP to be used is
31118
So took http://172.24.0.3:31118/ in browser

```
kubectl get pods -l app=nginx
```
It lists the pods under the label app=nginx

```
kubectl get pods --watch
```
The above command printed the chnages during the deployment


### Strategy:
  ```
  type: RollingUpdate  # Specify the update strategy
  rollingUpdate:
    maxSurge: 1    
  ```

- maxSurge: 1
    - Allow one additional pod over the desired replica count during update
- maxUnavailable: 1   
    - Allow one pod to be unavailable during update
